# Python-Projects-Weekly
Here I will post atleast one python project every week!!

1. QR Code
   I think that this is the first project of many the students learning python. So here is mine. This project takes the URL of any website, product, and create the QR for it. Through this project, I mainly learned to import libraries and use it.

2. Personal Expense Tracker
   This project taught me a lot. I could say that this project also revised my almost all the python learnings till this date. 

3. Bank Management

4. Rcommendation System
